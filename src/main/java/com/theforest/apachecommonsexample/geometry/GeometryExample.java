/**
 * Space and coordinates.
 *
 * Commons Geometry is a general-purpose Java library for geometric processing. The primary goal of the project is to provide a set of geometric types and utilities that are
 *
     * mathematically correct,
     * numerically accurate,
     * easy to use, and
     * performant.
 * Key features of the library include
     * Support for Euclidean space in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions
     * Support for spherical space in 1 and 2 dimensions
     * Support for geometric elements of infinite size
     * Support for boolean operations on regions (union, intersection, difference, xor)
     * Support for reading and writing common geometric data formats, such as STL and OBJ
     * Single external dependency (commons-numbers)
